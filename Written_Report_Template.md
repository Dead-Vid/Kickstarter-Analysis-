# Kickstarter Analysis Challenge

## Overview of Project
----------------------------------------------------------
### Purpose:

- The goal of this project is to manipulate a kickstarter campaign data sheet so that Louise can compare her play to others. More specifically, Louise wants to see how other kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. With the given data, we will be able to determine which campaigns proved to be successful or failures.   

## Analysis and Challenges
----------------------------------------------------------
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- looking at the outcomes based on launch date we can see two trends occurring. The first being campaigns launched in the early summer months (May and June) tend to be more successful than those launched in late fall/early winter months (November and December). The other trend we can see is that their seems to be more kickstarter campaigns launched in the middle of the year (April - August) as opposed to the start and ending of the regular calender year (September - March). 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- The chart and table we created to depict the outcomes based on goals shows Louise what campaigns were successful and what campaigns failed based off how much money was asked for. It appears that campaigns that required less money tended to be more successful than those asking for muchh more. If you look at the chart below. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- When creating the "Outcomes Based on Goals" Chart, I found it difficult to understand the order the =COUNTIFS function criteria needed to be in. Through trial and error I was able to write a function that not only pulled the correct data from one sheet to another, but also learn what I was doing wrong and apply it to other data sheets. Using the hint given in the challenge outline, Microsoft's excel help page, and youtube tutorials, I was able to grasp the concepts needed to complete the challenge. The sources I used are listed below:

## Results
----------------------------------------------------------
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
